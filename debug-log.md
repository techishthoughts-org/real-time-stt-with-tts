# Debug Log - Mobile App Module Resolution Error

## Initial State
- **Error**: "unable to resolve module mobile-app"
- **Current Directory**: `/Users/arthurcosta/dev/personal/real-time-stt-with-tts/packages/mobile-app`
- **Timestamp**: $(date)

## Step 1: Examine Current Directory Structure
Let me check the current mobile app structure and package.json to understand the module resolution issue.

---

## Step 2: Identified Root Cause
**ERROR FOUND**:
```
Unable to resolve module ./packages/mobile-app/index from /Users/arthurcosta/dev/personal/real-time-stt-with-tts/packages/mobile-app/.:
None of these files exist:
*packages/mobile-app/index(.ios.js|.native.js|.js|.ios.jsx|.native.jsx|.jsx|.ios.json|.native.json|.json.ios.ts|.native.ts|.ts|.ios.tsx|.native.tsx|.tsx)
*packages/mobile-app/index
```

**PROBLEM**: Metro bundler is looking for `./packages/mobile-app/index` but it should be looking for `./index` since we're already in the mobile-app directory.

**CAUSE**: This suggests there's a configuration issue where the app is trying to resolve the module from the wrong base path.

---

## Step 3: Solution Steps
1. Check app.json configuration
2. Verify Metro configuration
3. Check if there are any import statements with incorrect paths
4. Fix the module resolution configuration

---

## Step 4: Root Cause Identified
**MAJOR ISSUE FOUND**:
- User is running `npx expo start` from the root directory `/Users/arthurcosta/dev/personal/real-time-stt-with-tts/`
- But the mobile app is located in `/Users/arthurcosta/dev/personal/real-time-stt-with-tts/packages/mobile-app/`
- Expo is trying to find `./packages/mobile-app/index` from the root directory
- The correct approach is to run expo from the mobile-app directory

**SOLUTION**:
1. Navigate to the mobile-app directory
2. Run expo start from there
3. Ensure all dependencies are properly installed

---

## Step 5: Current Error Status
**CURRENT ERROR**:
```
ConfigError: Cannot determine the project's Expo SDK version because the module `expo` is not installed. Install it with `npm install expo` and try again.
```

**ISSUE**: Still running from root directory instead of mobile-app directory.

**IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED**:
1. Ensure we're in the correct directory: `/Users/arthurcosta/dev/personal/real-time-stt-with-tts/packages/mobile-app`
2. Verify expo is installed in the mobile-app package
3. Run expo start from the mobile-app directory

---

## Step 6: Comprehensive Test Suite Created
**TEST FILES CREATED**:
1. `src/__tests__/App.integration.test.tsx` - Integration tests for the main app
2. `src/__tests__/store.test.ts` - State management tests
3. `src/__tests__/security-audit.test.ts` - Security validation tests
4. `src/__tests__/VoiceAssistantContext.test.tsx` - Voice assistant functionality tests

**TEST COVERAGE AREAS**:
- ✅ App initialization and lifecycle
- ✅ Authentication flow and state management
- ✅ Error handling and recovery
- ✅ Navigation and routing
- ✅ Security features and validation
- ✅ Voice assistant functionality
- ✅ Performance and memory management
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ Network security and SSL validation
- ✅ Biometric authentication
- ✅ Data encryption and privacy
- ✅ Rate limiting and session management

**TEST ISSUES FOUND**:
1. React version compatibility (React 19 vs testing libraries)
2. Missing security service method implementations
3. Jest configuration needs updates for React Native 2025

**TEST RESULTS SUMMARY**:
- Total Tests: 25
- Passed: 1
- Failed: 24
- Main Issues: React compatibility and missing service methods

---

## Step 7: Test Validation Summary
**COMPREHENSIVE BEHAVIOR VALIDATION CREATED**:

### App Behavior Tests:
- ✅ App initialization with loading states
- ✅ Authentication flow (login/logout)
- ✅ Error handling and user feedback
- ✅ Navigation between screens
- ✅ Health check and connectivity
- ✅ App state management (background/foreground)

### Security Tests:
- ✅ Token storage and retrieval
- ✅ Data encryption/decryption
- ✅ Biometric authentication
- ✅ SSL certificate validation
- ✅ Input sanitization
- ✅ Password strength validation
- ✅ Session management
- ✅ Rate limiting
- ✅ Data privacy and anonymization

### Voice Assistant Tests:
- ✅ Listening functionality
- ✅ Speaking functionality
- ✅ Connection management
- ✅ Audio level monitoring
- ✅ Transcription handling
- ✅ Response processing
- ✅ State synchronization
- ✅ Error recovery
- ✅ Performance optimization

### State Management Tests:
- ✅ Authentication state
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Loading states
- ✅ State persistence
- ✅ Concurrent updates
- ✅ Performance under load

---

## Step 8: Next Steps for App Validation
**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS**:
1. Fix React version compatibility issues
2. Implement missing security service methods
3. Update Jest configuration for React Native 2025
4. Run tests in isolation to validate each component
5. Create end-to-end test scenarios
6. Validate app behavior on actual devices

**VALIDATION CHECKLIST**:
- [ ] App starts without module resolution errors
- [ ] Authentication flow works correctly
- [ ] Voice assistant functionality is operational
- [ ] Security features are properly implemented
- [ ] Error handling provides good user experience
- [ ] Performance meets requirements
- [ ] All tests pass successfully
